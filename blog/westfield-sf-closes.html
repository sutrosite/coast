  As Westfield, the operator of the San Francisco Centre mall, leaves the San Francisco area, coming with it is the giant goods retailer, Nordstrom. After both companies leave the city, the mall's vacancy will drop to 45%, one of the lowest numbers in its history. This, however, may be a good thing for the city.
  As more and more businesses leave the San Francisco Centre, other competing companies in the area may generate more business. As Cinemark, the mall's only theater tenant, leaves the city, the nearby AMC, a tenant at the nearby Metreon mall only 1 block away, may start generating more revenue. Westfield has also noticed how the San Francisco malls revenue dropped 40-45% between 2019 and 2022, while nationally the mall chains average revenue raised in other malls by 20-25%, with the Westfield Valley Fair in San Jose having 66% higher revenue.
  According to the New York Times, “Downtown malls have always been a rare sight, given the limited space available in city centers for sprawling shopping areas. But those that have been built have long relied on a steady flow of foot traffic from local residents, office workers, convention goers and tourists.” This tells us that San Francisco, once one of the richest cities on the West Coast for its culture and profitability, can rise back again with some good planning. Some journalists and planners have suggested that this growth may be similar to New York City’s uprising to become the city that it is today.
  The good news is that other big retailers in the mall, such as Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale’s, plan to stay in the San Francisco market. According to a spokesperson at Bloomingdale’s, the chain is “dedicated to providing exceptional service” in the San Francisco area.
  To sum it all up, although San Francisco may be falling right now, can the city pick itself back up? Foreign investors that have never had a thought about San Francisco may get attracted to the new opening in the 1.5 million square feet mall, opening more opportunities and ideas from the half empty San Francisco Centre.
